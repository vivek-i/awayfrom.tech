## About ##
awayfrom.tech allows users to search for national parks and campgrounds, within their state. When a user clicks on a location, we provide snippets of information useful to the travel-goer, such as the location, what amenities the location has, activities available at the location as well as a short description of the location. If the location is far from the user, they can also search and book flights to the location directly off our website. Data sourced from various government apis
